# Growtopia-Project-Chaos

**Hey everyone !**


 i'm working on a multibotting / networking internal software for Growtopia called Project Chaos.


the progress made in the app so far is so great and so good and going as planned, the multibot system in the app would be dominate and real game changing.

one of the features of the app is that unlike other multibotting softwares it would allow unlimited bot connections saving you A LOT of money spent on rdp's.

also it would have a proxy within the program to help the client enter securely and avoid having your ip banned.

the app would have many other great features, like multiple internal cheats, pathfinding, lua executor, auto surgery, spamming and automsg, cid creator,
item library, growscan built in the program, advanced multibotting and internal client based autofarming, and its own Voice Activated A.I Assistant [ not sure about this one yet. ]

and many other features within 1 app. the current work on the app is designing and planning, testing and updating each feature on its own till its close to being perfect

it would forsure be a paid app as the work on it would be so hard and i can't just give all of that for free, but for a cheap fair price.

the price would be determined later on based on how many would buy etc etc...

but it wont be more than 10 dls and definitely way less than that for a month license.

as for the permanent price for the app. not quite sure about this one yet. but something hopefully fair for both of us.

the progress might be a bit slow as i'm the only one working. but if i felt that the app is ready enough, it'll be released in an uncompleted shape and will be updated daily

one of the exciting features is that unlike other autofarm and spam applications, this one is internal memory based and networking based making smarter and more advanced.

i'll have a discord server down below and i'll documentate every bit of progress, post screenshots, release demo versions for the ones who bought the app before its released, and more deatailed info about the software and the features.

you can join the server to put down your suggestions or see the progress made.
feel free to join!!
